# Encrypt-O-Pedia
A Java application that Encrypts and Decrypts and Image and a Text using the selected algorithm (AES or DES)and store it on the user's system at a predefined Path (can be changed in the code, according to convenience) and user defined file Name. Its a smart application and keeps track of User activities at ever instance and hence the log can be saved before and instance is killed, so that the user has track of the algorithm and the key used for any particular encryption or decryption.

##Built With
The apllication was developed using Java in Netbeans IDE, therefore, it is advisable to run the code in the same environment.

##Requisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

[Netbeans 8.2](http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/8.2/rc/bundles/netbeans-8.2-windows.exe)
[JDK for Netbeans 8.2](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html)

Note: You can use any IDE that runs Java,Java FX, Java SE, and SUN libraries. The above stated were used for development and deployment.


##Testing
The application was tested for both white box and black box during development simultaneously as this practice saved the duration for development. As any bugs/errors that were found were rectified and patched during their discovery itself before moving to the development of the next module/functionality. Basically, the bottom-top was approached during the development and agile testing was done. The automated profiling of the apllication and its modules and functions were carried out using the tools available in netbeans IDE.

##Versioning
This is the Very first version of the application since deployment and hence no specific convention has been used for it. Incase of later releases, assigning a proper versioning would be considered.
